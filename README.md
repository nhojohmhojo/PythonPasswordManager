## 🧰 Installation
## 🧰 Build & Run as Executable

This project includes a Windows build script using **PyInstaller**. It generates both a `dist/` version and a renamed copy in the **project root** for easy access.

| Platform     | Script                | Output Executable(s)                                               | Run Command                             |
|--------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 🪟 Windows    | `WindowsInstall.bat`   | `dist/register_user.exe` and `Python Password Manager.exe` (root)   | `start "" "Python Password Manager.exe"` |

### ✅ The script will:

- Check for or create a virtual environment
- Install all dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Use `pyinstaller` to build an executable (`.exe`)
- Move or rename the build result to the project root for convenience
